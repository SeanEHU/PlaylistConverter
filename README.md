Object Oriented Programming coursework project

The original aim of this project was to allow users to take playlists created on one streaming service, and then transfer them to another streaming service.
The project was unsuccessful in achieving its ultimate aim, as it is currently unable to access or modify data held within a streaming serviceâ€™s database. 
  However, a functional GUI based application capable of managing abstract playlist data has been produced. 
  Allowing a user to Create new playlists, add and remove song data from playlists, 
  save playlist data locally as a .CSV file and to read playlist data from a locally saved .CSV file.
